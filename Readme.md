This is my first big project,💻 and I learned a lot while building it. With some help from GPT and a lot of self-study, I managed to put together a simple Python console app.🚀🐍
 Along the way, I picked up concepts like basic Python syntax, organizing scripts, handling user input, and debugging errors. I also got to use data structures like lists to store data and dictionaries to keep things organized. I'm really proud of what I've made and excited to share it! - That “aha!” moment when it finally works 🎉Proud of this milestone—onward to more code! .
